# Digital ML code

I hope this code is to your approval. I haven't done any tests aside from the basics.

This is just a simple app, the task is to filter the beer based on strength using the PunkAPI.

Using SCSS Modules to encapsulate the code so the styles don't pollute each other allowing for a more
modular behaviour with components whilst maintaining a global code base.

## Running code

`yarn start`

I have ESLint, Stylelint and Prettier installed, but only locally configured

Helmet hasn't been set up, but wanted to include it as an example of a page having some control.

I would have spent more time on configuring the plugins to give better feedback in real time,
this is to prevent poor code being pushed and reducing the need for lots of testing
